    "If you are familiar with the deep learning framework Keras, then the SpatialDataGenerator (SDG) resambles the standard Keras ImageDataGenerator class [1 F. Chollet. 2016]. The main difference is that SDG extracts sample data from a single large raster file. This setting is more convenient for remote sensing applications, where the dimensions of an input image file are not equal to the dimensions of a single sample. For example you will find often that a raster file dimiensions are far bigger than the sample dimensions that you want to feed to a deep learning model. In other words a single raster file is likely to contian a large number of samples.\n",

An example of this technique is shown in section 4, where the sample set min/max is passed to a normalization callback."
